# Galleria Del Burger

## Deployed App



## Description

* Galleria-Del-Burger is a logging app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Each burger in the devoured area has a `Spit!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move back to the left side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
